        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
        when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the
        Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
        force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from
        rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had
        planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
                Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
                dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was
                demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the
                Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and
                using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which
                would remain with him even in death.

                <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
                <p>
                    As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or
                    searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.

                    <p>The other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking
                    Thranduil. They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they
                    reached Lake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested
                    by the river.</p> 

                    At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with
                    Balin and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.

                    Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of
                    Five Armies, and all three were buried with honor.

                <h3>Oin</h3>
                <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was
                    King Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling.
                    Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with
                    Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one
                    of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and
                    his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most
                    skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later
                    settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dain Ironfoot II along with many other dwarves of The
                    Company of Thorin.

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin
                and younger brother of Óin.

                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of
                the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16 years old.

                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
                March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin
                to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned hobbits,
                Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling
                distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell"

                <h3>Dwalin</h3>
                <p>
                    Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin
                    and younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin
                    accompanied Thrain the Second and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

                    Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he
                    left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA
                    2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood
                    from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to
                    Thorin to inform him the news.

                <h3>Balin</h3>
                <p>
                    Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen
                    Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                    A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
                    friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble house of
                    Durin.

                    He later went to re-establish the kingdom of Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more
                    by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.
